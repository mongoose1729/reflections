What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

  It appears that initialializing a repository creates a git object.  That
  object allows the git program to keep track of different versions of the
  project files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is just a temporary vehicle.  It only exists to determine
  what will be added to the repo.  The repository and working directory
  continue to exist, regardless of whether the user is operating on them.  The
  value is that it allows you to modify a temporary variable while deciding
  what you want to put in the repository, before you commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  You can use git diff --staged to compare the differences between the latest
  commit and what you are about to commit.  That comparison will tell whether
  the difference represents one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized?  How would branches help?

  Branches would be helpful if I was adding a whole new functionality to a
  program, or taking someone else's program in my own direction.
