When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This would be useful if you are not at your local computer. It would
  also be useful if you are collaborating, and want your work to get
  onto the shared branch more quickly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Another user might modify the repo, and you may not approve of those
  changes or want to incorporate them into your local repo
  automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

  Forks and clones are similar - a fork is a clone directly from
  another GitHub account onto your account.  But forks allow all the
  changes to be tracked back to the original author (so they get
  credit for their work).  A branch takes an existing project in a
  different direction, but that happens within one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?

  The benefit of having a remote stored locally is that it allows you
  to merge with the latest available branch of a repo.  In particular,
  if you cannot connect to the remote (eg if you're traveling), having
  a local copy still allows you to merge with the most recent branch
  of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be
easier, and what would be harder?

  Without GitHub, I would likely just save multiple versions of a file
  and email them around.  This would make it easier in the sense that
  I wouldn't have to learn all the new lingo associated with Git.  But
  it would involve a lot of work to manually track versions and
  changes, rather than letting the Git software do that work for me.
